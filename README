There are two ways to build OpenMotif: (Imake and AutoTools)

IF you are using Imake please read INSTALL.imake for notes on how
to build and install this product using Imake. 

Please see the file INSTALL.configure on how to build and install
this product using the autoconf tools. This method is not yet supported
and doesn't always work. The recomended build method is still using
Imake.
