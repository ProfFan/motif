This document provides Release notes for Open Motif 2.3.1.
This contains information on what is new in Open Motif 2.3.1.
Please see the COPYRIGHT.MOTIF file included with this release.


Introduction

This document and accompanying text files contain important
information. Please read them carefully before starting the build and
installation procedures.

There are two ways to build Open Motif from source code: (Imake and AutoTools)

If you are using Imake please read INSTALL.imake for notes on how
to build and install this product using Imake. This method is depricated
due to lack of support. Users wishing to apply/test and patch the Imake system
should join the development mailing list; all contributions are welcome. 

Please see the file INSTALL.configure on how to build and install
this product using the autoconf tools. This method is now fully supported
and is the recommended build method.



1 What is Open Motif 2.3.1

Open Motif is the freely available source code distribution for the Motif
user interface component toolkit.  Open Motif is built on top
of the standard X Toolkit(Xt) and X11 libraries.

1.1 Overview of Open Motif

Open Motif 2.3.1 is an updated version of 2.2.  Any applications
built against a previous 2.X release of Open Motif will be binary
compatible with this release.  This is a source code release.
Pre-compiled versions are available for download at the MotifZone:

http://www.openmotif.org

After downloading this source distribution, it will need to be unpacked
and compiled.  The distribution contains the following items:

     libXm source code and include files
     Open Motif reference documentation (man pages)
     Utility libraries
     Demo programs
