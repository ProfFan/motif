This document provides Release notes for Motif 2.3.0
This contains information on what is new in Motif 2.3.0
Please see the COPYING file included with this release.


Introduction

This document and accompanying text files contain important
information. Please read them carefully before starting the build and
installation procedures.

There are two ways to build Motif: (Imake and AutoTools)

IF you are using Imake please read INSTALL.imake for notes on how
to build and install this product using Imake. This method is depricated
due to lack of support. Users wishing to apply/test and patch the Imake system
should join the development mailing list, all contributions are welcome. 

Please see the file INSTALL.configure on how to build and install
this product using the autoconf tools. This method is now fully supported
and is the recommended build method.



1 What is Motif 2.3

Motif is the freely available source code distribution for a
user interface component toolkit.  Motif is built on top
of the standard X Toolkit(Xt) and X11 libraries.

1.1 Overview of Motif

Motif 2.3 is an updated version of 2.1.  Any applications
built against a previous 2.X release of Motif will be
compatible with this release.  This is a source code release.
After downloading the distribution, it will need to be unpacked
and compiled.  The distribution contains the following items:

     libXm source code and include files
     Motif reference documentation (man pages)
     Utility libraries
     Demo programs

6. Documentation

For postscript and pdf documentation (users guides
and reference manuals), see URL
http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/docs/

7. Compatibility Notice

Some structures in existing widgets have been changed in
Motif 2.3. This can cause binary incompatibility problems which require
a recompile of your application. One recommended solution is to install
the runtime libraries from Motif 2.1.x. Link all your new applications to
the current Motif Shared Library.

Motif 2.3 is not binary compatably with 2.2  or 2.1, existing applications
will want to install the runtimes for older versions. 

8. Change Log

2.2.3 August 2002

a. uil support for the new widgets was finished along with demonstrations in 
the periodic demo.

b. several bugs were fixed. 

c. automake building is supported in an object directory. 


2.2.1 January 29, 2002

a. The Test directory that contained the automated tests was 
mentioned in the Release Notes but absent from source distribution. 
The reference in the Release Notes was removed. The Tests are still
available from the CVS tree.

b. Due to an oversight, imake support was not included in 
distribution. It was added back in this update.

c. If an older version of Motif was installed, the Autoconf
build would pick up the older #include files and fail. The
Autoconf configuration files were updated to use the proper
#include files.

d. Formating errors in doc/man/man3/Makefile.am were corrected.

e. The directory demos/unsupported/motifshell contained no source 
code but was mentioned in configure.in. The proper source code was
placed in this directory.

f. ToolTip.c and SlideC.c were included in config.h twice. The
extra reference was removed.

g. The demos for the new widgets were originally placed in the
directory demos/programs/newwidgets. To maintain consistency,
they were moved to demos/programs.

h. The Releases Notes specified the incorrect resource names for
enabling tooltips and specifying the string. These typos were
corrected. 

i. Compatibility note for user developed widgets was added to
Release Notes.
