This document provides Release notes for the Beta Release of Motif 2.3.0.
This contains information on what is new in Motif 2.3.0. Please see the
COPYING file included with this release.


THIS IS A BETA RELEASE
This is a Beta release of Motif 2.3. It is not intended for any production
use. Developers are urged to test existing applications against this release and
report any bugs they may find. Developers are also urged to try out the new
features including:

 * Client-side anti-aliased font support via XFT
 * UTF-8 and UTF8_STRING atom support
 * Ability to show text and pixmaps in Label, LabelGadget, and all
   derived widgets
 * Support of PNG and JPEG image formats in the same way as XPM is supported


Introduction

This document and accompanying text files contain important
information. Please read them carefully before starting the build and
installation procedures.

There are two ways to build Motif from source code: (Imake and AutoTools)

If you are using Imake please read INSTALL.imake for notes on how
to build and install this product using Imake. This method is depricated
due to lack of support. Users wishing to apply/test and patch the Imake system
should join the development mailing list; all contributions are welcome. 

Please see the file INSTALL.configure on how to build and install
this product using the autoconf tools. This method is now fully supported
and is the recommended build method.



1 What is Motif 2.3

Motif is the freely available source code distribution for the Motif
user interface component toolkit.  Motif is built on top

c. Fixed building procedure under FreeBSD.
d. Fixed building procedure in order to make it usable with new versions of
autoconfig.


2.2.3 August 2002

the periodic demo.

c. Automake building is supported in an object directory. 


2.2.1 January 29, 2002

a. The Test directory that contained the automated tests was 
mentioned in the Release Notes but absent from source distribution. 
The reference in the Release Notes was removed. The Tests are still
available from the CVS tree.

b. Due to an oversight, imake support was not included in 
distribution. It was added back in this update.

c. If an older version of Motif was installed, the Autoconf
build would pick up the older #include files and fail. The
Autoconf configuration files were updated to use the proper
#include files.

d. Formating errors in doc/man/man3/Makefile.am were corrected.

e. The directory demos/unsupported/motifshell contained no source 
code but was mentioned in configure.in. The proper source code was
placed in this directory.

f. ToolTip.c and SlideC.c were included in config.h twice. The
extra reference was removed.

g. The demos for the new widgets were originally placed in the
directory demos/programs/newwidgets. To maintain consistency,
they were moved to demos/programs.

h. The Releases Notes specified the incorrect resource names for
enabling tooltips and specifying the string. These typos were
corrected.
