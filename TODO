----------------------------------------------------------------

-Make new widgets thread safe

-Make new widgets conform to Motif 2.1 model by supporting:
    *Traits 
    *Render Tables 
    *Xme draw routines 
    *Uniform Transfer Model (UTM) 
    *Fast Subclassing 

- Update from use of deprecated and obsolete features:

- Validate backwards compatibility
    *Fix ToolTips Vendor-Shell extension that broke Motif 2.1
    compatibility.
    *May want to use traits instead of adding a new resource.

        XmResolveAllPartOffsets

- Get rid of non-TOG artifacts
    *Copyright notices to ICS and others throughout code
