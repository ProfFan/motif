This is used to keep track of the XSETTINGS property. At least, the gnome
themes use this when switch themes. This allows OpenMotif applications
to switch when the gnome theme is changed. Unfortunately there are not
OpenMotif themes yet :( So to use this ....

gnome theme changes make an attempt to change the look of Xt based toolkits,
but in my experience, it is not done very well. It uses files in

/usr/share/control-center-2.0/xrdb

So, first of all, edit the *.ad files in that directory and comment out
_all_ of the lines.

Next you have to create the theme resources. For now the only theme directory
that is searched is

$HOME/.themes

So, to create two themes to play with, create the following files

$HOME/.themes/Bluecurve/Xm/xrdb.ad:
*background:    #efede7
*XmTextField.background:    white

$HOME/.themes/Clearlooks/Xm/xrdb.ad:
*background: gray75
*XmTextField.background:    gray75

You should be able to get started by

cp -r /usr/share/themes/Bluecurve /usr/share/themes/Clearlooks $HOME/.themes

and then create the xrdb.ad theme files. You can then start whatever
application you use to switch gnome themes and this application should
follow the changes .... That's all there is to it :)

So far there is only a very limited number of resources that can be "themed",
still need to determine which resources are "safe" to change on the fly ...
